### Prerequisites

 1. Guvnor installed on one or more servers
 2. A modern web browser

### Setup

Here `$CONFIG_DIR` is `/etc/guvnor` if you are root or `$HOME/.config/guvnor` if you are not.  

Unless you want it to listen on privileged ports (e.g. 80 or 443), you do not need to be root to run guvnor-web.

It's generally advised to not run processes as root unless you absolutley have to, so please consider running guvnor-web as a non-priveleged user.

#### Step 1. Create a user to log in as

```sh
$ guv-web useradd alex
```

#### Step 2. On the machine Guvnor is running on, obtain the host config

```sh
$ sudo guv remoteconfig

Add the following to your guvnor-web-hosts file:

[foo-bar-com]
  host = foo.bar.com
  port = 57483
  user = root
  secret = ZD57XFx6sBz....
```

Create a file named `$CONFIG_DIR/guvnor-web-hosts` with the output from the `remoteconfig` command.

#### Step 3. Still on the Guvnor machine, add a remote user

```sh
$ sudo guv useradd alex

[alex.foo-bar-com]
  secret = LsYd5UaH...
```

The file `$CONFIG_DIR/guvnor-web-users` should have been created during step 1 - open it and add the output from `useradd`.

#### Step 3a.  Optionally override which user you connect as

If you wish to log in to guvnor-web as `alex`, but need to administer a process running on a remote host as `alan`, you can override the user you connect to a given server in `$CONFIG_DIR/guvnor-web-users`:

```sh
[alex.foo-bar-com]
  user = alan
  secret = LsYd5UaH...
```

#### Step 4. Start guvnor-web

```sh
$ guv-web
```

### Running guvnor-web with guvnor

Ouroboros style:

```sh
$ guv web
```

### Every time I restart guvnor-web I have to re-accept a self-signed certificate!

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) still future tech?  Generate a 30 day self-signed certificate with:

```sh
$ guv-web genssl 30
```

If the number of days is omitted it defaults to one year.

Alternatively if you've bought an SSL certificate, configure guvnor-web according to the comments in the `[https]` section of the [default configuration](../guvnor-web) file.
